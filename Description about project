I am happy to share insights with my first Power BI dashboard!
Analyzing Superstore sales and profit data like never before - from raw dataset to decision making Visuals.
I got this data set from Kaggle and working with this data by using various types of Power BI Visuals like: Stacked Bar Chart, Donut Chart, Pie Chart, Matrix, Line Chart, Card, Slicer and many More.
Clustured Bar Chart - Segment V/s Profit & Sales;
Donut Chart - Profit V/s Category;
Pie Chart - Profit V/s Region;
Pie Chart - Sales V/s Region;
Line Chart - Profit and Sales V/s Year and Quarter;
Matrix - Region Vs Sub Category Vs Sum of Profit Vs Sum of Sales;
Card - Sum of Sales, Sum of Discount, Sum of Profit and Sum of Quantity;
Slicer - By State and By region;

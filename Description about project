I am happy to share insights with my first Power BI dashboard!
Analyzing Superstore sales and profit data like never before - from raw dataset to decision making Visuals.
I got this data set from Kaggle and working with this data by using various types of Power BI Visuals like: Stacked Bar Chart, Donut Chart, Pie Chart, Matrix, Line Chart, Card, Slicer and many More.
